## 🚀 Why Sharkey?

As an active crypto user, I experienced the frustrations of juggling multiple apps, poor UX, and lack of meaningful analytics. Sharkey solves that by bringing everything essential into one privacy-focused, AI-enhanced wallet — with deep user insight and full non-custodial control.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Grants

I'm currently building Sharkey **solo** — no team, no funding. Just one developer on a mission to rethink crypto usability and privacy.

I’m open to grant support and partnerships with ecosystems like **Rango, Filecoin, zkSync, Biconomy, Ocean Protocol**, and others who share the vision of accessible, secure, and intelligent crypto experiences.
